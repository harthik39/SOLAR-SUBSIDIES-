        <p><b>Solar energy is a renewable and sustainable source of power derived from the sun's radiation. It is a crucial component of the broader category of renewable energy, which aims to harness naturally occurring resources that can be replenished over time. Solar power is increasingly recognized as a clean and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.</b></p>

        <h1>Photovoltaic (PV) Solar Cells</h1>
        <p>==>> Description: Photovoltaic cells, commonly known as solar cells, directly convert sunlight into electricity. When sunlight hits the semiconductor material in the solar cells, it generates an electric current.
           <br><br> Applications: Used for residential and commercial solar power systems.</p>

            <p><b>Description:</b> Solar thermal systems harness the sun's energy to produce heat. This heat can then be used for various applications, such as heating water or generating steam for electricity generation.
            <br><br>    <b>Applications:</b> Solar water heaters, solar space heating, and solar thermal power plants.</p>
            <p>Solar thermal encapsulates any technology that takes sunlight and converts it into heat. That heat can then be used for three primary purposes: to be converted into electricity, to heat water for use in your home or business, or to heat spaces within your house. Each of these options requires distinct technologies, but all of them harness the power of the sun to offset some portion of your energy needs.</p>
            <p>Solar thermal is different from solar photovoltaics in that solar thermal technologies use the heat from the sun to produce energy, while solar photovoltaics take advantage of the "photovoltaic effect" of some semiconductors like silicon to produce a flow of electricity right from the sun's rays.

                <p><b>Description:</b> CSP systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a small area, typically to generate heat. The concentrated heat is then used to produce steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity.

                    Concentrated solar power (CSP) is an approach to generating electricity through mirrors. The mirrors reflect, concentrate and focus natural sunlight onto a specific point, which is then converted into heat. The heat is then used to create steam, which drives a turbine to generate electrical power.</p>

                <p><b>Description:</b> These systems use sunlight to heat water for residential or industrial use. There are two main types: passive solar water heaters and active solar water heaters.
                <br><br>    <b>Applications:</b> Residential hot water systems, swimming pool heating.</p>

                <p><b>Description:</b> Solar energy can be used to power vehicles, either directly through solar panels on the vehicle or indirectly by generating electricity for electric vehicles.
                 <br><br>   <b>Applications:</b> Solar-powered cars, solar-assisted electric bicycles.</p>
                <p>A solar vehicle is an electric vehicle powered completely or significantly by direct solar energy. Usually, photovoltaic (PV) cells contained in solar panels convert the suns energy directly into electric energy. The term solar vehicle usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicles propulsion.</p>

            <h1>Solar Irradiance:</h1>
            <img src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2018/02/16132201/How-Earth%E2%80%99s-magnetic-field-protects-us-from-solar-radiation.jpg">
            <br><br>
            <p><b>Definition:</b> Solar irradiance is the power per unit area received from the Sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range of the measuring instrument.
               <br><br> <b>Units:</b> Typically measured in watts per square meter (W/mÂ²).
                <br><br><b>Importance:</b> It represents the amount of solar power available at a particular location.
                </p>
                <p><strong>What is Solar Irradiance?</strong> <br>Irradiance is a measure of solar power. Because power refers to the rate of energy transfer over time (not the total amount of energy delivered), another way of thinking of irradiance is that it quantifies the amount of solar energy that arrives in a particular area in a given moment [Watt/m2].</p>         

               <br> <h1>Solar Panel Capacity:</h1><br><br>

               <br><br>
               <p<b>>Definition:</b> The capacity of a solar panel refers to its maximum power output under standard test conditions (STC).
               <br><br><b> Units:</b> Typically measured in watts (W) or kilowatts (kW).
               <br><br> <b>Importance:</b> It indicates the potential electrical output of a solar panel.</p><br>
               <p>The size of a solar panel is measured in watts, which indicates the amount of power it can generate. The most common solar panel sizes for residential installations are between 250W and 400W, while larger commercial installations may use panels up to 500W or more.</p>
